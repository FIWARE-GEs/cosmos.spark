The Cosmos Generic Enabler enables easier BigData analysis over context, integrated with some of the most popular
BigData platforms.

Cosmos is a FIWARE Generic Enabler. Therefore, it can be integrated as part of any platform “Powered by FIWARE”. FIWARE
is a curated framework of open source platform components which can be assembled together with other third-party
platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions.

You can find more info at the [FIWARE developers site](https://www.fiware.org/developers/) and the main
[FIWARE site](https://www.fiware.org/).

## What is Cosmos?

The Cosmos BigData Analysis GE is a set of tools that help achieving the tasks of Streaming and Batch processing over
context data. These tools are:

-   Orion-Flink Connector (Source and Sink)
-   Apache Flink Processing Engine
-   Apache Spark Processing Engine
-   Streaming processing examples using Orion Context Broker

## Why use Cosmos?

As the state of the real world changes, the entities representing your IoT devices are constantly changing. Big data
analysis allows for the study of datasets coming from your context data which are too large for traditional
data-processing software. You can apply predictive analysis or user behaviour analytics to extract meaningful
conclusions as to the state of your smart solution and bring value to your solution.
